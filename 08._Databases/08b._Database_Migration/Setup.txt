Python file
pip install mysql-connector-python


Explanation
    1. Database Configuration: Define the source and destination database configurations.
    2. Connect to Databases: Use the mysql.connector.connect method to connect to both the source and destination databases.
    3. Fetch Data: Execute a SQL query to fetch all data from the source table.
    4. Insert Data: Insert the fetched data into the destination table.
    5. Error Handling: Basic error handling to catch common connection issues.
    6. Close Connections: Ensure all database connections and cursors are closed properly.

Considerations
    - Data Transformation: If you need to transform data during migration, add that logic before inserting it into the destination database.
    - Batch Processing: For large databases, consider processing data in batches to avoid memory issues.
    - Indexes and Constraints: Ensure that indexes, constraints, and foreign keys are properly handled during migration.
    - Data Validation: Implement thorough validation to ensure data integrity in the destination database.
